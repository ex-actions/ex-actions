# ex-actions

This was autogenerated. [Go to ex-actions/ex-actions for the source](https://github.com/ex-actions/ex-actions).

This repository contains multiple github actions for your elixir projects. In
general, setup-mix should be what you need, but all the internal actions are
located here too.

## Basic Usage

Use as a step in your workflow:

```yml
jobs:
  test:
    name: 'Test'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: 'backend'

    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v3'

      - uses: 'erlef/setup-beam@v1'
        with:
          elixir-version: '1.14.1'
          otp-version: '25.1.1'
          version-type: 'strict'

      - uses: 'ex-actions/setup-mix@main'
        with:
          working-direcory: 'backend'

      - name: 'mix test'
        run: 'mix test'
```

## Documentation

### [ex-actions/setup-mix@main](actions/setup-mix/README.md)

Sets up your mix project. It will install dependencies, compile dependecies,
compile your application, and do its best to cache each step.

### Internal Actions

They are used internally as a part of setup-mix, but are extracted here in case
you need more granular control over your project.
